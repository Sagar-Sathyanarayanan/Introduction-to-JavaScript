/*Write a for (note: not a function) loop that prints out the factorial of the number 12:

A factorial is calculated by multiplying a number by all the numbers below it. For instance, 3! or "3 factorial" is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 63!=3∗2∗1=6
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 244!=4∗3∗2∗1=24
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 1205!=5∗4∗3∗2∗1=120

Save your final answer in a variable called solution and print it to the console.
